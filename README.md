# arduino_monotron
The code is for Arduino and is supposed to control a Korg Monotron via MIDI


Done:
CV pitch tracking,
Filter control,
pseudo exponential ADSR,
Legato,  Portamento and normal mode,
pitch bend,
logarithmic scaling for adsr pots,

Todo:
add several modes for legato,
lfo pitch tracking,
Velocity,
LFO,
MIDI CC control,
VCA,
Upload schematics,
Exponential ADSR curves,
When in Legato, let the decay continue or it creates artifacts with short notes
