# arduino_monotron
The code is for Arduino and is supposed to control a Korg Monotron via MIDI


Done:
CV pitch tracking,
Filter control,
pseudo exponential ADSR,
Legato,  Portamento and normal mode,
pitch bend,
logarithmic scaling for adsr pots,
LFO saw, ramp, square, random, triangle

Todo:
add several modes for legato,
lfo pitch tracking,
Velocity,
VCA,
Upload schematics,
code with functions written correctly,
When in Legato, let the decay continue or it creates artifacts with short notes
add a proper modulation matrix with several lfos and env going to different destinations
