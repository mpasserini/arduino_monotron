# arduino_monotron
The code is for Arduino and is supposed to control a Korg Monotron via MIDI


Done:
CV pitch tracking
Filter control
Linear ADSR
Legato,  Portamento and normal mode
pitch bend

Todo:
Fix legato, so that it keeps the highest pitch note, not it keeps the last
Velocity,
LFO,
MIDI CC control,
VCA,
Upload schematics,
Exponential ADSR curves,
When in Legato, let the decay continue or it creates artifacts with short notes
